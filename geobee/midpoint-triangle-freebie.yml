problem: Let $\triangle ABC$ be an equilateral triangle with area $16$. Let the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ be $D$, the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$ be $E$, and the midpoint of $\overline{CA}$ be $F$. What is the area of $\triangle DEF$?

      $\overline{AF}$ and $\overline{AD}$ have the same length, half of the length of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, $\angle AFD = \angle ADF$. $\angle DAF = 60^{\circ}$, so $\angle AFD = \angle ADF = 60^{\circ}$. By this same reasoning, we can see that $\triangle ADF$, $\triangle CEF$, $\triangle EBD$, and $\triangle DEF$ are all equilateral triangles. We also see that these four triangles all have the same measure of side length. Thus, $\triangle ADF$, $\triangle CEF$, $\triangle EBD$, and $\triangle DEF$ are congruent and have the same area. If the sum of the areas of the four triangles is 16, then the area of $\triangle DEF$ is \boxed{4}.
