problem: Farmer Eggbert has a rectangular field $ABCD$ such that $\overline{AB} = 12$ and $\overline{AD} = 6\sqrt{3}$. He has a sprinkler installed at point $A$, which has a watering radius of $12$ (any part of the field within a distance of $12$ from $A$ will be watered). What is the area of Eggbert's field which is not within the watering range of the sprinkler?

      We can first calculate the area of the rectangular field that is within the watering range. We can draw a circle centered at $A$ with a radius of $12$ to represent the part of the field that is within the watering range. Let point $E$ be the point where this circle intersects $\overline{CD}$ between $C$ and $D$. The area that gets watered is equal to the area of $\triangle ADE$ plus the area of sector $ABE$. Since $\overline{AE} = 12$, Pythagorean Theorem gives $\overline {DE} = 6$. $\triangle ADE$ must also be a 30-60-90 triangle, with $\angle DAE = 30^{\circ}$. $\angle EAB$ then equals $60^{\circ}$. We can calculate the areas to be:$$[\triangle ADE] = \frac{6 \times 6\sqrt{3}}{2} = 18\sqrt{3}$$The sector $EAB$ has area:$$12 \times 12 \times \pi \times \frac{60^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}} = 24\pi$$The area of the field that is not within the watering range is the area of the whole field minus the two areas calculated above: $$12 \times 6\sqrt{3} - 18\sqrt{3} - 24\pi = \boxed{54\sqrt{3} - 24\pi}$$
